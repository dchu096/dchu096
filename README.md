### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me

 Iâ€™m a coder that breaks everything from pieces to pieces.

# Currently working on:

MEmubot is just a random bot that i make for MEmu discord server. The main target is to actually replace the most 2 common bots named dyno and carl. The reason why is these 2 bots in the server dont do much. Carl only do roles assignment and dyno do moderations. So i decide to create MEmubot to basically do them all + music for rythm replacement.
