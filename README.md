### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me

 Iâ€™m a coder that breaks everything from pieces to pieces. Tutorials? Obviously **NO**. I would be the person who likes to create something different out of what the devs put in tutorial. fiddle around with every settings until the stuff breaks, or put a bunch of codes until the bot overloads. Thats me!

# Currently working on:

MEhost.
