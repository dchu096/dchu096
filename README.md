### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me

 Iâ€™m a coder that breaks everything from pieces to pieces. Tutorials? Obviously **NO**. I would be the person who likes to create something different out of what the devs put in tutorial. fiddle around with every settings until the stuff breaks, or put a bunch of codes until the bot overloads. Thats me!

# Currently working on:

MEmubot is just a random bot that i make for MEmu discord server. The main target is to actually replace the most 2 common bots named dyno and carl. The reason why is these 2 bots in the server dont do much. Carl only do roles assignment and dyno do moderations. So i decide to create MEmubot to basically do them all + music for rythm replacement.


Droid Fighter is a tutorial from unity. Named FPS shooter and i just extended it using imagination and try to create somehow another thing which is so different to what the tutorial is like

Webpage is also a mess.
